Asmeta is a framework for the Abstract State Machines (ASMs) formal method. It is composed of different <a href="download/index.html">tools</a> for performing different validation and verification activities.

It is based on the definition of a <a href="metaapproach.html">metamodel</a> for ASMs. For the <strong>metamodel semantics</strong>, we adopt the ASMs semantics given in the <a href="http://www.di.unipi.it/~boerger/AsmBook/">ASM book</a>.
<!--p>A standard <strong>AsmM Library</strong> containing predefined ASM domains and functions is also provided.</p-->

<!--p>Around the AsmM we have developed and we are developing a <a href="download/index.html">set of tools</a>.</p-->

<!--h2>Asmeta tool set</h2>

Around the AsmM we have developed and we are developing a <a href="download/index.html">set of tools</a>:

<ul>
  <li>(available) the AsmetaL compiler: to compile an ASM specification written in AsmetaL to xmi</li>
  <li>(available) the AsmetaS simulator: to simulate an ASM specification</li>
  <li>(available) Asmee: a plugin for eclipse for AsmetaL and AsmetaS</li>
  <li>(available) ATGT: a test generator for Asms</li>
  <li>(available) the AsmetaV validator: to test/validate an ASM specification</li>
  <li>(available) the AsmetaSMV model checker: to model check an Asm specification</li>
  <li>(available) the AsmetaMA model advisor: to check for common defects of AsmetaL models</li>
  <li>(available) the AsmetaRE: to generate executable ASMs from Use Case models</li>
  <li>(available) the SCA-ASM: a language and an engine for service oriented components</li>
  <li>(available) AsmRefProver: a prover of refinement correctness</li>
  <li>(available) AsmetaVis: a graphical visualizer for ASMs</li>
  <li>(work in progress) a graphical editor</li>
  <li>(work in progress) Asmeta animator</li>
</ul-->
