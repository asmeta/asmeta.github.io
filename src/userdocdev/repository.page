The source base of Asmeta (including the documentation and the web site) is maintained now in a GitHub organization. The code is hosted here:

<a href="https://github.com/asmeta/asmeta" target="_blank">https://github.com/asmeta/asmeta</a>

To checkout the code, use your favorite git tool.


### Repository Organisation

* under code there is the source code. In core all the basic projects. Under extensions all the tools we have built and are now part of asmeta.


### Working with the Asmeta sources
The better way is to use eclipse and checkout the projects from the svn.
