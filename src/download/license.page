## Asmeta licensing information
Asmeta is released under the GPL license:<br/>
<pre><var>Copyright (c) 2005, 2006 FMSELAB @ UNIMI (http://fmse.di.unimi.it/)<br/><br/>License Information: https://github.com/asmeta/asmeta/blob/master/LICENSE<br/><br/></var>Asmeta is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br/>modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License<br/>as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2<br/>of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br/><br/>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br/>GNU General Public License for more details.<br/><br/>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br/>along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br/><br/>Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA</pre>
<br/>
However, since Asmeta software relies on several libraries and the
eclipse plugin uses Eclipse software, which are free but not GPL
compatible, we add an exception (as suggested by the FSF):<br/>
<pre>In addition, as a special exception, FMSELAB @ UNIMI gives permission to link the code of this program with <br/>the JMI &amp; MDR (all the jar files distributed by the mdr project of netbeans), LOG4J and eclipse libraries, <br/>and distribute linked combinations including the two, as long as these libraries remain released under a free software <br/>license according to the FSF.<br/>If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the<br/>file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to<br/>do so, delete this exception statement from your version.<br/></pre>
Asmeta is GPL compatible.<br/>
<br/>
Asmeta will be released with an EPL licence soon.<br/>

<h2>Dual Licensing</h2>
If you like to use Asmeta and do not want to use the GPLed version of
Asmeta (for example you want to embed Asmeta in a proprietary non free
software), contact us: we can provide Asmeta with a non free license
according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_license">
dual licensing model</a>.<br/>

<h2>FAQ on licensing</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Can I use ASMETA software to develop non-free ASM specifications?<br/>
    </b></dt>
  <dd>Yes, because the copyright on the editors and tools included in
ASMETA does not cover the code and the specifications you write. Using
them does not place any restrictions, legally, on the license you use
for your code.</dd>
