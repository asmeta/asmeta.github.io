A <strong>graphical front-end</strong> called Asmee (ASM Eclipse Environment) which allows to edit and manipulate AsmM models. This environment is implemented as eclipse plug-in.

### Eclipse plugin
The editor is available as eclipse plugin. Follow the instructions [here](./index.html#installing-asmeta-in-eclipse)

<!--p>Download <a href="http://fmse.di.unimi.it/asmeta/download/asmee_site.zip"> asmee_site.zip</a> which contains a zipped version of the asmee update site. Unzip it and copy it in a temporary directory (for example c:\temp\asmee). Then update eclipse like in Option 1, except that in step 3 choose new Local Site and select the directory (c:\temp\asmee) where you have unzipped the asmee_site.</p-->

<h2>How to use Asmee</h2>
<p>After you have installed the Asmee plugin, you will have in eclipse the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a wizard to <strong>create a new AsmetaL file</strong>: go to File-&gt;new File-&gt; Other -&gt; AmsetaL new File. It creates a new file. Note that the name of the asm and of the file must be the same. You probably will need also the standard library, that you can download from <a href="https://github.com/asmeta/asmeta/blob/master/asm_examples/STDL/StandardLibrary.asm">StandardLibrary.asm</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>synthax hightlighting</strong> (you can change the colors in the preferences: go to Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Asmeta -&gt; Asmee)</li>
</ul>
